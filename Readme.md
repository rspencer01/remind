Remind
------

A simple reminder tool for linux, written in python.  Just for my own use.  However, feel free to submit pull requests etc if you want to add functionality.

I use this by putting a line in my `.bashrc` to call the program every time I open a terminal.  Since this is often, I get a nice reminder.  You can also use `crontab` to add monthly reminders.
